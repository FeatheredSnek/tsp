Hello there, Mireska! Taking a stroll in these ancient woods? Who would have thought that you’re such a nature person, right?

Oh, some people seem to like the solitude of Middelaine – but absolutely, I’m here for the nature. Y’know, breathing fresh air, listening to birdsongs, picking f l o w e r s.

Mhm, no doubt about that. But you could as well admire birds and bees elsewhere. I’m not letting you into to the river, sis. They’ve warned me beforehand.

Predictably! So the eyes of a ranger are upon me? Are you going to teach me the truth about right and wrong? Jex here thinks you’re no fun.

Well, no ethics classes here, no. I’ll simply force you to leave, right, wrong, alive, dead, whatever suits you!

------

Right as always, Jex – no fun at all.
