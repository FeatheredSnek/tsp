# The Sunbreeze Project: Lily of Dereliction DEMO

## About

The Sunbreeze Project: Lily of Dereliction is a crossover fanart of both Dota and Touhou Project. It is a playable bullet-hell game demo set in the Dota world. The audio-visual stylistics and core gameplay mechanics emulate those found in Touhou games, while the content - setting, charaters, enemies, attacks - references Dota.

Features:
- One autoscrolling stage and a classic Touhou boss fight with multiple spellcards.
- Dota spells, attacks and effects represented as bullet patterns.
- Overly convoluted scoring system inspired primarily by Perfect Cherry Blossom.
- Hand-drawn 2D graphics overlayed on a low-poly 3D scrolling background.
- Three music tracks featuring soundfonts and low quality FM synth patches.
- Two main difficulty levels and customizable difficulty settings.
- (Recommended) keyboard and (rudimentary) gamepad controls.

## Tech

The game was developed using Godot Engine v3.2.1.
2D assets and animations made in Adobe PS & AE.
3D assets modeled and painted in Blender.
Music made in LMMS.
Everything except the UI fonts designed, coded and developed solo from scratch.

## Downloads

You can clone and export the repo using Godot 3.2.1 or download the exported executables at [the project's website](https://dorianm.com/demos/tsp/).
Be wary that I did not bother to optimize the game so its rather hardware demanding for a 2D shooter.
